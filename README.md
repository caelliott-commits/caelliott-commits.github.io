## Useful Sites I Recommend
- [YouTube](www.youtube.com) - I have solved many an issue in my school work and on personal projects by looking up tutorials on YouTube. I am a visual learner so I find this more useful sometimes than reading instructions.
- [Quizlet](www.quizlet.com) - I have found this incredibly helpful when studying for quizzes or tests. Great resource for memorizing vocabulary or concepts.
- [Udemy](www.udemy.com) - I took a course on here years ago when I was experimenting with Swift, but there is such a vast array of classes and instructors on here. Reasonable pricing too, in my opinion.
